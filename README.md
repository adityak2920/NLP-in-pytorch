# NLP-in-pytorch
In this repo i have included some of Natural Language Processing(NLP) algorithms like RNNs and LSTMs and some of the algorithms on how to convert word to vector and Markov chains also for text predictions
### 1. Markov Chains
  Link to see visulisation of markov chain:

### 2. Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)
  To learn in details about the effectiveness of rnn and it's uses click on link below

### 3. Long Short Term Memory Network(LSTM)
  To further read about the problems of RNN network and to know why do we need LSTMs and the network structure of LSTMs link:

  Note: The LSTM code is fully functional i have basically given an outline of code so i will update in few days
